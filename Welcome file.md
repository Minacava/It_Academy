Follow these steps:

2. Click on **Start Writing Now!**
3. Delete any text that currently exists in the editor 
4. Use Markdown to create the documentation shown in the screen short below.

Note that: 

* "Stauts Code" is heading level 1 and " Common codes" is heading level 2   
* "status code" is italic 
* "404" is monospace
* The table header row does not need to be bold. This is taken care of by the just making the row the header row

## Status Code

## Common codes

| Code | Description 
|--------|----------|
|200 | OK|
|403 | Forbidden|
